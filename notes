Notes from amy and katie:

When explaining model selection processes a more positive
relationship isn’t necessary a better model - it’s more about
model diagnostics

Unclear why removed outlier? This needs to be better
justified to ensure you're not just removing it to try and create
the result you want (i.e. does it improve model diagnostics?)

Don’t think we need to know plotID, even though it looks
nice, extra info the audience doesn’t need to know because
not related to hypothesis test

Would have been helpful to have a line for mean on
histograms and comparing it to normal distribution – remind
the audience what normal and bimodal look like

If you’re doing a multiple linear regression, best to show
partial residual plots
